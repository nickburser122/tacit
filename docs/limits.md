# Known limits

These come from Android itself. Tacit doesn't work around them with root, hacks or anti-features.

- **Settings**: Tacit finds Settings *screens*. It can't find individual toggles inside them; that search index needs system privileges. Vendor skins (Samsung, Xiaomi) expose fewer screens.
- **Files**: Android/data, Android/obb, other apps' private storage and cloud-only files can't be searched without root. Full search needs "All files access". Without it you can grant individual folders, but Android won't let you grant the storage root or the Download root that way.
- **Clipboard lock**: only available when the phone has a screen lock set.
- **Clipboard**: Android 10+ only lets the app on screen read the clipboard. Tacit saves what's on the clipboard each time you open it; copies made in between are missed.
- **App shortcuts**: only available while Tacit is the default home app.
- **No internet**: no currency rates, no search suggestions, no update checks.
- **WhatsApp**: going straight to a chat needs WhatsApp's contact entry or a number with a country code (set a default country code in Settings).
